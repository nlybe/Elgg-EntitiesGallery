# Attach photos on Elgg Entities

![Elgg 4.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Elgg-4.3-orange.svg?style=flat-square)

This plugin offers users the feature to create galleries and upload photos.

Users can attach a gallery with photos to other Elgg entities and Groups, as well as to add their personal galleries.

Site admin can determine on which entities subtypes users can add photos.

The plugin uses the [DropzoneJS API for Elgg](https://github.com/nlybe/elgg-dropzonejs) plugin for photos upload and elgg-light box for photos navigation.

## Installation

Use the following composer command to install the plugin:

```bash
composer require nlybe/egallery
```
